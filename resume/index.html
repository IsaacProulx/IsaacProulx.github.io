                Shopify Packing Slip Template Customization - 
                <a href="https://github.com/IsaacProulx/Shopify-Projects/tree/main/packing%20slip%20template%20mod" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The  Constance Bay Community Market sold individual products as well as a  Cheer Box that contained a number of items that were not sold separately in the shop. To allow volunteers to pack a customer’s entire order, the market manager requested a customization to the packing slip that showed all of the items in the Cheer Box, as well as any other individual products the customer ordered. I wrote some custom Liquid/HTML to determine if the customer had purchased a Cheer Box, and if so, to print the Cheer Box contents at the top of the packing slip.</p>

                <li>an interpreter for Brainf*ck that adds extra features, such as labels</li>

            </h3>
            <p>I was learning assembly for the Intel 8048  so I could write games for the Magnavox Odyssey 2. To compile the assembly files, I had to type a long string on the command line. I wanted a way to avoid typing the command every time I tested or wrote a new program. I wrote this Batch script that allows a user to select which file to assemble, and then automatically assembles the file (using the aswcurr assembler).</p>
